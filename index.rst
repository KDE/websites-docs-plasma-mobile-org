"*Plasma Mobile aims to become a complete software system for mobile
devices. It is designed to give privacy-aware users back the
full-control over their information and communication. Plasma Mobile
takes a pragmatic approach and is inclusive to 3rd party software,
allowing the user to choose which applications and services to use. It
provides a seamless experience across multiple devices. Plasma Mobile
implements open standards and it is developed in a transparent process
that is open for the community to participate in.*"
